- Initialized project log file.
- Step 1 completed: CSV ingestion pipeline runs from `main.py`.
- Step 2 completed: structured parsing and validation.
- Added `read_csv_records` to convert rows into typed records (`int`, `float`, `str`).
- Added CSV quality stats: `total_data_rows`, `valid_rows`, `skipped_bad_rows`.
- Verified by running `python main.py`.
